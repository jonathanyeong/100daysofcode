# Diceware passphrase generator
[**GITHUB repo**](https://github.com/jonathanyeong/diceware_passphrase_gen)
I want to build this... maybe in JS?

We take a list of key value pairs -> https://theworld.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc

We generate 5 random numbers (between 1-6 each)

We allow the user to choose the number of words

We allow the user to choose the delimiter between each word (space, asterik, number etc)

## Vue notes

data.message doesn't seem like a variable for example:

```
 <div id="app">
    {{ message }}
    {{ message2 }}
  </div>

  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello World!',
      mesage2: 'Another message'
    }
  })
```

Doesn't show the second message.

`v-bind` is a directive. All directives are prefixed with `v-`. Directives apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.

---
`v-for` could help with the diceware project. We could use this to loop over a csv.

---
`v-model` directive makes a two way binding between form input and app state.

---
Use components in Vue to build up an interface. Almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components.

---
A `prop` is like a custom attribute.

---
MVMM Model (Model - View - ViewModel) - ViewModel is a value converter. It is responsible for exposing (converting) the data from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented.

The key diff between this and a controller is that the MVVM pattern has a binder, which automates communication between the view and its bound props in the view model. The view model is described as a state of the data in the model.

---

What is the reactivity system? When a vue instance is created, all props found in `data` will be added to the reactivity system. Anytime those values change, the view will "react", updating to match the new values.

**NOTE**: Props in `data` are only reactive if they exited when the instance was created. If you need that prop later, you should set an initial value when initializing the vue instance.

40 minutes into the tutorial, I realized there's a Vue 3 coming out...

Might as well start using that! Unfortunately, I don't know how much my knowledge from the previous tutorial will apply to Vue 3.

## Vue 3 Notes
You need to call `mount` after you create app. I guess this is in place of the lifecycle call backs. It seems like you have a bit more control this way.

Shorthand for `v-bind` == `:`
Shorthand for `v-on` == `@`
