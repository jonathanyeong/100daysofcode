# Day 5 (2020/08/08)
## What did I work on
- Get some random numbers generated
- Display random numbers on the screen.
- Have the amount of numbers react to the form inputs.

## What did I learn?
- I played around with v-model and event handling in view. The `@change` event will capture any change to the field.
- I also learnt that you have to set the default data value otherwise it won't react to events.

## How did I feel?
- At the start of the session I wanted to refocus on what I wanted to work on. Trying to tackle how to load a CSV file + generating the passphrase seemed like a big job. Especially, since I didn't know that much Vue. But focusing instead on generating random numbers that will be used for lookups later really helped.
- I felt like I had a good amount of coding vs watching tutorials. Reading the docs only got me so far, I needed to watch someone write vue code before I got it.

# Day 4 (2020/08/06)
## What did I work on?
- Learnt more about VueJS components.
- Setup a project with Vue CLI.

## What did I learn?
- How to create and import components.
- There's also something with the naming that I don't quite understand, but keeping it mind for later.

## How did I feel?
- I skipped yesterday because I was super tired. Definitely felt much better today. I still don't feel productive with Vue. I don't know how to get the idea in my head into code.

# Day 3 (2020/08/04)
## What did I work on?
- Research on Erlang - history, features, language.
- Played around with concurrency (heavily influenced by Ping Pong)

## What did I learn?
- How concurrency works in Erlang.
- Just a bunch of stuff about Erlang's history.

## How did I feel?
- It took me pretty much all day to feel motivated enough to tackle and hour of code.
- Also, I'm not sure if I'm doing it write. I feel like I'm reading more then coding.

# Day 2 (2020/08/03)
## What did I work on?
- Started learning Vue (switched to learning Vue 3 halfway through session).
- Thought of a project to work on - generating a passphrase.

## What did I learn?
- MVVM architecture.
- Basic creation of a Vue app.

## How did I feel?
- I felt good, but it definitely felt like a slog reading through the VueJS documentation. I'm wondering if I should've just looked at tutorials instead.
- Trying to figure stuff out on my own is rewarding, but also disheartening at the same time.

- Started building out files for the new site.

## How did I feel?
- Tired in the beginning, but soon got in the zone. And worked past the hour.
