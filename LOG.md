# Day 3 (2020/08/04)
## What did I work on?
- Research on Erlang - history, features, language.
- Played around with concurrency (heavily influenced by Ping Pong)

## What did I learn?
- How concurrency works in Erlang.
- Just a bunch of stuff about Erlang's history.

## How did I feel?
- It took me pretty much all day to feel motivated enough to tackle and hour of code.
- Also, I'm not sure if I'm doing it write. I feel like I'm reading more then coding.

# Day 2 (2020/08/03)
## What did I work on?
- Started learning Vue (switched to learning Vue 3 halfway through session).
- Thought of a project to work on - generating a passphrase.

## What did I learn?
- MVVM architecture.
- Basic creation of a Vue app.

## How did I feel?
- I felt good, but it definitely felt like a slog reading through the VueJS documentation. I'm wondering if I should've just looked at tutorials instead.
- Trying to figure stuff out on my own is rewarding, but also disheartening at the same time.
